# 🌍 AI-Powered Grocery Intelligence

## Overview  
This project is building the **future of grocery intelligence** — a platform that combines **AI forecasting, real-time data, and immersive visualization** to help grocery retailers operate smarter, reduce waste, and improve food availability.  

Our mission is bold: **empower every grocery store — from local shops to global chains — with the tools they need to thrive in a data-driven era.**

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters  
Food retail faces massive challenges:  
- Billions lost every year due to **overstocking and spoilage**  
- Empty shelves when demand is underestimated, hurting **customer trust**  
- Local grocers struggling to compete with data-rich national chains  

This project tackles these head-on. By fusing **machine learning, external signals (weather, holidays, social trends)**, and **interactive store mockups**, we create a system that doesn’t just forecast demand — it **explains it**.  

Impact at scale:  
- 📉 Reduce food waste  
- 🛒 Increase product availability  
- 💡 Level the playing field for local businesses  
- 🌱 Support sustainability and climate goals

## ✨ Features  
- **Forecasting Engine** – Predict sales at SKU, department, and store levels  
- **Demand Drivers Dashboard** – See how external factors influence demand  
- **Interactive Store Mockup** – Hover over aisles for insights and analytics  
- **Evaluation Metrics** – MAE, RMSE, WMAPE, bias, coverage  
- **Data Integrations** – Weather, USDA pricing, Google Trends, POS systems  
- **Alerting System** – Detect overstock/understock risks before they happen

## 🌐 Vision  
We imagine a future where **every grocery store has Amazon-level forecasting power**, where shoppers always find what they need, and where **millions of tons of food waste are eliminated**.  

This is more than software — it’s about **reshaping how food moves from shelf to shopper**.
